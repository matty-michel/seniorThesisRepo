## Week 1 Summary (09/22/2025)

### This week I worked on:

I set my Unity project up with GitHub and worked on my Design Document for my game.

### This week I learned:

When setting up a repository with a gitignore file, the file has to be in the root folder of the Unity project.
Each time the project is opened or closed, there are hundreds of files that are updated.

### My successes this week were:

I further developed all of the features and mechanics I want in my game.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

I struggled to set up version control the first time around because I had my gitignore file in the wrong place.
